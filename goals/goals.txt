This file contains my random thoughts for things I want to add to this mod.

Things I want to do:
 * Separate Filters from Signals. Currently, Gates are both Filters and Signals. Filters should specifically check if an
   item meets a condition. Signals should check if a condition is met that is not dependent on an item.
 * Make it so that Transpositioners can be placed on things besides inventory blocks, because some modules do not need
   to be adjacent to inventories to function.

Modules I still want to add:
 * Item Data Filter - This filter only allows items that have NBT data matching the one in its (ghost) inventory.
   - Icon is that of a module with a split icon on it. One half is a potion, the other half is a partially damaged
     pickaxe, and the divider is a blue line down the middle.
 * Item Durability Filter - This filter only allows items whose remaining durability is optionally greater or less than
   the given percentage.
   - Icon is that of a module with a split icon on it. One half is partially damaged hoe, the other half is a partially
     damaged pickaxe, and divider line is blue.
 * Ref Item Mover (Mk1 & 2) - This is like an item mover but instead of moving between the two inventories adjacent to
   the transpositioner, the mover moves between two inventories referenced by Inventory Reference modules. This module
   would also have a filter module slot to give control over the items being moved. The Mk2 would, like the normal Mk3
   Item Mover module, be able to control the stack size and frequency of movements.
 * Adjacent Inventory Ref - This is an inventory reference to an adjacent inventory.
 * Connected Inventory Ref - This is an inventory reference to an inventory in a position that can be reached from the
   transpositioner by only traversing inventory blocks.
 * Ender Inventory Ref - This is an inventory reference to an inventory anywhere within a certain radius.
 * Player Inventory Ref - This is an inventory reference to a player's inventory.
 * Inventory Contents Signal - This is a gate module that only allows items to pass if an item can be found in its
   referenced inventory that satisfies its item gate.
 * Storage Inventory - This module actually stores items in the Transpositioner. It can be referenced by Storage
   Inventory Refs. There might be different Mk's with different storage amounts.
 * Storage Inventory Ref - This is an inventory reference that can reference an inventory in another module in the same
   Transpositioner.
 * Crafting Inventory - This is an inventory split into two parts: input and output. The input inventory is used with
   this module's crafting recipe to create output items that are then put into the output inventory. Both of these
   inventories can be referenced by inventory references.
 * Smelting Inventory - This is an inventory that is split into three parts: input, fuel, and output. Each of these
   inventories can be referenced by inventory references. There might be a version that takes power from a power
   reference to smelt items.
 * Block Placer - This module will place a block that it can get from an inventory reference.
 * Block Breaker - This module will break a block and put the item into a referenced inventory.
 * Item User - This module will use an item. There may be a version that takes usable items from an inventory reference.
   There should also be a way to supply items that are also in the "player"'s inventory but are not used. This could
   possibly be a Mk1, Mk2, Mk3 kind of situation.
